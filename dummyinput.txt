[09:12] Agent joins conversation

AGENT: Good morning! Welcome to HelpSphere Support. My name is Daniel. 
Before we begin, could you please confirm your registered email?

CUSTOMER: Hi Daniel! Sure — it’s aisha.patel92@email.com. I’m seeing some strange charges.

AGENT: Thanks, Aisha. I’ve located your account. For verification, can you confirm the phone number 
we have on file? It should end in 4412.

CUSTOMER: That one’s old. My current number is (646) 555-4412. I also have an international number: 
+91 22 6789 1234.

AGENT: Perfect, updated. I see a transaction for $399.00 dated February 1st. 
Is that the one you're calling about?

CUSTOMER: Yes, that’s one of them. It was supposed to be $39.00. There’s also a charge for 
$8,765.43 that I definitely didn’t approve.

AGENT: I understand — let me review the transaction history. The $399.00 payment was processed 
at 11:18 AM on your card ending in 7821. Does that sound right?

CUSTOMER: Yes, that’s my card: 7821-4567-9821-3344. But I never approved $8,765.43!

AGENT: Checking our logs now. The purchase was made through 
https://www.helpsphere.io/store/checkout at exactly 11:18:52, and a receipt was emailed to you.

CUSTOMER: I visited https://support.helpsphere.io/faq and 
https://helpsphere.io/plans/standard — but I never completed checkout for that amount.

AGENT: Understood. Could you tell me what device you were using?

CUSTOMER: My desktop computer. I also logged in later from my phone at 6:45 PM using 
https://m.helpsphere.io.

AGENT: Thanks for waiting, Aisha. The $399.00 charge is valid, but the amount is incorrect. 
The $8,765.43 charge does not appear in our system — it may belong to another merchant.

CUSTOMER: Checking now… oh wow, you’re right. That charge is from 
GlobalTravelHub.com — my bad!

AGENT: No worries at all. I’ve issued a partial refund of $360.00 for the pricing error. 
You’ll receive confirmation at aisha.patel92@email.com within 3–5 business days.

CUSTOMER: That’s great, thank you! Can I also get a text confirmation?

AGENT: Absolutely. We’ll notify you at (646) 555-4412. Anything else I can help with?

CUSTOMER: Yes — I want to add my business partner as an authorized user. 
Her email is leonard.kim@enterprise-group.co.kr.

AGENT: Sure thing. What’s her contact number?

CUSTOMER: +82 2 3456 7890. She’s in Seoul.

AGENT: Perfect. Invitation sent to leonard.kim@enterprise-group.co.kr.
